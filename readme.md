# Expanding the coverage of spatial proteomics
Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.29.526114v2

## Usage
Jupyternotebook demo shows how to use our algorithm for choosing a minimal predictive subset of markers that allows the 
prediction of a set of markers in multiplexed protein images;
- folder 'single' contains the demo for single-panel experiments;
- folder 'mp' contains the demo for multi-panel experiments.


## Datasets
All the data are relevant CODEX image data from [HuBMAP](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/). The images barcodes can be found under the folder 'csv'.

## Acknowlegements
fnet code is modified from [AllenCellModeling/pytorch_fnet](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/pytorch_fnet). We thank their contribution for providing the open source software.
